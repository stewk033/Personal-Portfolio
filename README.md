# Personal-Portfolio
# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

This assignment requires the creation of a portfolio for purposes of showcasing my work to future employers. I was able to use what I have learned in previous lessons to add several functions to the site, making it easier to navigate.

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

* _GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work_
* _WHEN I load their portfolio_
* _THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them_
* _WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation_
* _THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section_
* _WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work_
* _THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications_
* _WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application_
* _THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others_
* _WHEN I click on the images of the applications_
* _THEN I am taken to that deployed application_
* _WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices_
* _THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport_
